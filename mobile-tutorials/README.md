## ðŸš€ Quick Start

If you want to run the completed mobile app:

```bash
cd mobile
npm install
npm start
```

Development with backend integration:
```bash
# Start the NestJS backend first
cd infrastructure
just dev-up

# Then start the mobile app
cd ../mobile
npm start
```

Access points:
- **Expo Dev Tools**: http://localhost:19002
- **API Backend**: https://api.interestingapp.local
- **Mobile App**: Scan QR code with Expo Go app

## ðŸ“– How to Use This Tutorial

1. **Follow sequentially** - Each tutorial builds on the previous
2. **Test on device** - Use Expo Go app for real device testing
3. **Backend integration** - Ensure NestJS backend is running
4. **Experiment** - Try variations and understand the concepts

## ðŸŽ“ Learning Objectives

By completing this tutorial series, you'll understand:

- **Expo & React Native** development workflow and best practices
- **TypeScript** integration with React Native components
- **Navigation patterns** for mobile apps (tabs, stacks, authentication flows)
- **API integration** with secure token management
- **Native device features** (camera, notifications, storage)
- **Mobile UI/UX** design patterns and accessibility
- **Production deployment** with EAS Build and app stores

## ðŸ’¡ Integration with NestJS Backend

This mobile app is designed to work seamlessly with the NestJS Docker Backend:

- **Shared Authentication** - JWT tokens from NestJS auth system
- **API Endpoints** - All CRUD operations through NestJS REST API
- **User Management** - Profile updates sync with backend database
- **Image Upload** - Photos uploaded to NestJS file storage
- **Push Notifications** - Server-sent notifications via NestJS

## ðŸ”§ Development Workflow

### **Standard Development Cycle:**
1. **Start Backend**: `cd infrastructure && just dev-up`
2. **Start Mobile**: `cd mobile && npm start`
3. **Test Changes**: Use Expo Go app on physical device
4. **Debug**: Use React Native debugger and logs
5. **Build**: Create development or production builds with EAS

### **Backend Integration Testing:**
1. **API Endpoints**: Test login, registration, profile updates
2. **Authentication**: Verify token refresh and logout
3. **File Upload**: Test image upload and storage
4. **Notifications**: Test push notification delivery

## ðŸ“± Supported Platforms

- **iOS** - iPhone and iPad support
- **Android** - Phone and tablet support
- **Web** - Expo web build for browser testing
- **Development** - Expo Go for rapid development

## ðŸ”’ Security Features

- **JWT Authentication** with automatic token refresh
- **Secure Token Storage** using Expo SecureStore
- **API Request Interceptors** for authentication headers
- **Input Validation** and sanitization
- **Permission Management** for device features
